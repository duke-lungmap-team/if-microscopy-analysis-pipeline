A collection of scripts demonstrating how to use the tools in `micap`.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the developers of the [matterport/Mask_RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) repository
for open sourcing their code. We borrow heavily from that repository and utilize their code which generates random
shapes to demonstrate the utility of our code.
